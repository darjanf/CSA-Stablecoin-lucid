# Helios Lang

Helios is a Domain Specific Language that compiles to Plutus-Core (i.e. Cardano on-chain validator scripts). Helios is a non-Haskell alternative to Plutus.

Helios is purely functional, strongly typed, and has a simple curly braces syntax. It notably supports closures, functions with multiple return values, OOP-like methods, and enums as tagged unions.

The Helios library is written in Javascript, with complete Typescript type-coverage through JSDoc comments. This library lets you compile Cardano smart contracts and create Cardano transactions. Helios is all you need to build 100% client-side dApps for Cardano.

## Example: time-lock

```
spending time_lock

struct Datum {
    lockUntil:   Time
    owner:       PubKeyHash // the owner can always unlock the assets
    beneficiary: PubKeyHash // beneficiary can only unlock the assets after 'lockUntil'
}

func main(datum: Datum, _, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool {
    tx: Tx = ctx.tx;
    now: Time = tx.time_range.start;

    tx.is_signed_by(datum.owner) || (
        tx.is_signed_by(datum.beneficiary) &&
        now > datum.lockUntil
    )
}
```

## User guide

The Helios language and Helios API are covered extensively by the online [book](https://www.hyperion-bt.org/helios-book).

## Online playground

There is an online coding [playground](https://www.hyperion-bt.org/helios-playground?share=bd071424ebb752c3bbb2e2e45074c195).

## VSCode plugin

There is a VSCode plugin called *Helios* that can be installed through the extensions marketplace. Currently it only supports syntax highlighting. Please help us improve this extension by contributing to the [*helios-ide-plugins* repository](https://github.com/hyperion-bt/helios-ide-plugins).

## Sponsoring

For sponsoring we prefer using the Cardano blockchain itself (instead of Patreon or Github's sponsor system).
